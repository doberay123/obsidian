#### What is Knowledge?
Is knowledge just information, or is it something deeper. What even is it?

According to google:
>  facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.

Philosophically though, it holds a different meaning. In fact, it is a full field of philosophy called [[Epistemology]].

[[Plato]] originally answered the question of "What is knowledge?" as 
>Justified true belief

However, in 1963, [[Edmund Gettier]] challenged this definition with a counter example:
* Say Jones and Smith are applying for the same job
* The interviewer says "I will give Smith the job"
* Jones sees Smith count $10 in his pocket
* Thus, Jones creates the belief "The man who gets the job has $10 in his pocket"
* But then Jones gets the job, and coincidentally, he also has $10 in his pocket

Justification: he does hear the interviewer say that Smith will get the job and see that he has $10 in his pocket
True: the man who gets the job **does** have $10 in his pockets

**However**, it is luck which led him to being correct. Thus, this cannot be classified as knowledge. Therefore, Plato's definition of knowledge is insufficient as you can have a true justified belief which isn't knowledge.

There is another Gettier case, but honestly I'm not interested.

### Reflection
Honestly this doesn't mean a lot to me. I got GPT to pick me a topic and I researched it a bit. But now I can branch this off.

What are key concepts in epistemology?

The Fermi paradox was created by [[Enrico Fermi]] who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938. 

The Fermi paradox is a statement which aims to question to contradiction between the seemingly high likelihood for emergence of extraterrestrial intelligence and the lack of evidence for its existence. 

In simple terms, the paradox has two broad forms:
1. Why has Earth not already been visited?
2. Why is there no evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence at all?

If Earth really is so old, it should have been visited by extraterrestrial intelligence multiple times? Why is there absolutely no evidence of extraterrestrial life?

The following hypothetical explanations have been put forward to resolve this paradox.
# Explanations

## Rarity of Intelligent Life
#### Extraterrestrial life is rare or non-existent (rare Earth Hypothesis)

A multicellular organism such as humans is argued as being extremely rare in the first place. Considering the time taken for humans to evolve, specific conditions which were met to allow the evolution, it could be argued that the appropriate conditions for extraterrestrial life to form are rare or even unique to only Earth.

Most importantly, life would need whatever created prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, sexual reproduction, and the [[Cambrian Explosion]].

Within [[Stephan Jay Gould]]'s 1989 book *[[Wonderful Life]]*, he hypothesizes that:
>If one or two tweaks were made during the Cambrian Explosion, human beings probably never would have evolved into what they are today

#### Extraterrestrial intelligence is rare or non-existent

For the sake of the argument, consider extraterrestrial complex life such as complex multicellular organisms was common. Even if this was true, intelligence within these living things could not be as common.

As seen on Earth, other creatures intelligence are inferior to humans. As stated by [[Charles Lineweaver]]:
>Dolphins have had ~20 million years to build a radio telescope and have not done so

This suggests that even if extraterrestrial life is common, intelligence may not. Through this logic civilizations would also cease to exist, thus, ruling out the possibility of intergalactic communication with Earth.
